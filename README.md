## Why Wezzly?

Every AI assistant is **blind** — you have to describe what you're looking at, copy-paste text, upload screenshots.

**Wezzly can see.**

It watches your screen in real-time, understands what you're doing, and helps without the friction.

| Traditional AI | Wezzly Companion |
|----------------|------------------|
| "Paste the error message" | *sees your screen* "Line 47 has a typo" |
| "Describe what you're looking at" | *already watching* "That chart shows a downtrend" |
| "Upload a screenshot" | *sees it live* "I see you're on Twitter, want me to help?" |
| Can't watch videos | *watches with you* "At 2:34 he explains the key part" |

**No copy-paste. No uploads. It just sees.**
